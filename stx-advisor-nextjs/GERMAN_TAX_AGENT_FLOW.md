## Tax Calculation Logic

### Threshold Check
- **Early Exit:** If income < tax-free threshold for the year
- **Full Refund:** Tax paid amount
- **No Further Questions:** Skip deduction flow

### Tax Calculation Formula
```typescript
const taxableIncome = Math.max(0, grossIncome - totalDeductions);
const estimatedTax = taxableIncome * 0.15; // 15% estimate
const refund = Math.max(0, taxPaid - estimatedTax);
```

### Tax-Free Thresholds by Year
- 2017: â‚¬8,820
- 2018: â‚¬9,000
- 2019: â‚¬9,168
- 2020: â‚¬9,408
- 2021: â‚¬9,744
- 2022: â‚¬10,347
- 2023: â‚¬10,908
- 2024: â‚¬11,604
- 2025: â‚¬12,300

## Conversation Flow

### 1. Initial Data Extraction
- Extract PDF data (name, income, tax paid, year)
- Display summary to user
- Confirm tax year

### 2. Threshold Check
- If income < threshold â†’ Early exit with full refund
- If income â‰¥ threshold â†’ Continue to status selection

### 3. Status Selection
- Present 4 status options
- Validate user selection
- Load appropriate deduction flow

### 4. Deduction Questions
- Ask one question at a time
- Accept "yes"/"no" answers
- Track answers and amounts
- Calculate running totals

### 5. Final Summary
- Display comprehensive tax summary
- Show all deductions applied
- Calculate final refund amount
- Provide JSON summary

## LangSmith Tracing

### Traced Operations
1. **Data Extraction** (`setExtractedData`)
2. **Tax Calculations** (`calculate_tax_refund`)
3. **Deduction Checks** (`check_tax_deductions`)
4. **Agent Initialization** (`initialize_agent`)
5. **Conversation Turns** (`advisor_message`)

### Trace Data
- User inputs and responses
- Deduction answers and amounts
- Tax calculations and thresholds
- Conversation flow progression
- Error handling and fallbacks

## API Endpoints

### `/api/advisor`
- **POST:** Handle conversation flow
- **Actions:** `initialize`, `respond`, `reset`, `get_state`
- **Response:** Includes deduction flow state and tax calculations

### Response Structure
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "advisor_message": "string",
  "done": false,
  "deduction_answers": [...],
  "tax_calculation": {...},
  "deduction_flow": {
    "status": "bachelor",
    "current_question_index": 2,
    "total_questions": 5
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common Scenarios
1. **Invalid Status:** Prompt for valid selection
2. **Invalid Answers:** Request yes/no response
3. **Missing Data:** Fallback to OpenAI
4. **LangSmith Errors:** Continue without tracing
5. **API Failures:** Graceful degradation

### Fallback Mechanisms
- LangChain agent â†’ OpenAI direct
- Custom tracing â†’ Console logging
- Structured flow â†’ Free-form conversation

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Cases
1. **Below Threshold:** Early exit with full refund
2. **Bachelor Student:** Complete 5-question flow
3. **Master Student:** Complete 6-question flow
4. **New Employee:** Complete 6-question flow
5. **Full-time Employee:** Complete 6-question flow
6. **Invalid Inputs:** Error handling and recovery
7. **Multiple Years:** Session management

### Expected Outcomes
- Correct deduction calculations
- Proper tax refund estimates
- Complete conversation flow
- LangSmith trace visibility
- JSON summary generation

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for AI responses
- `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`: Required for tracing
- `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT`: Project name for traces
- `LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT`: LangSmith endpoint

### Performance
- Session-based state management
- Async LangSmith operations
- Memory-efficient conversation history
- Graceful error handling

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **More Deduction Categories:** Health, charity, etc.
2. **Dynamic Thresholds:** Real-time tax law updates
3. **Document Upload:** Receipt processing
4. **Multi-language Support:** German interface
5. **Advanced Calculations:** Progressive tax rates
6. **Export Options:** PDF reports, tax forms
